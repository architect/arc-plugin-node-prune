## [`@architect/plugin-node-prune`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@architect/plugin-node-prune)

> Node.js-specific Architect plugin based on [`node-prune`](https://github.com/tuananh/node-prune) that cleans `node_modules` cruft from your Lambdas during deployment


## Warning

Pruning your `node_modules` tree(s) has some inherent risks. While we have found it to be stable and reliable, the packages your project uses may provide different results.

For example: while unlikely, a package that includes and makes use of a file with a commonly `.npmignore`d filename may be impacted by this pruner. For a list of files and folders that are pruned, please [review the pruner script source](https://github.com/architect/plugin-node-prune/blob/main/prune.sh).


## Installation

1. Run: `npm i @architect/plugin-node-prune`

2. Then add the following to your Architect project file (usually `.arc`):

```
@plugins
architect/plugin-node-prune
```

> Note, no `@` in the plugin name!

3. Deploy your project (`npx deploy`) and watch the filesizes drop ðŸ“‰


## Results

In practice, we have seen average filesize and file count reductions of about 25-30% across the board. That's a meaningful number for cloud functions!


## Disabling the plugin

If for whatever reason you need to disable the plugin, simply comment it out in (or remove it from) your Architect project file:

```
@plugins
# architect/plugin-node-prune
```


## Limitations

- Architect supports shared code by selectively copying `src/shared` and `src/views` into all Functions' `node_modules` dirs by default.
  - Because this plugin runs just prior to deployment, it must avoid Architect shared code dirs so as not to inadvertently destroy user files.
  - As such, any `node_modules` folders within `src/shared` or `src/views` will not be pruned.
- This plugin relies on shelling out to a bash script, so ymmv on Windows.
